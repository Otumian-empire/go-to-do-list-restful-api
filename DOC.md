# Todo List Restful Api Using Golang

1. **API Endpoints:** Define the endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. These could be:

   - `POST /tasks` to create a new task
   - `GET /tasks` to retrieve a list of all tasks
   - `GET /tasks/{taskID}` to retrieve a specific task
   - `PUT /tasks/{taskID}` to update a specific task
   - `DELETE /tasks/{taskID}` to delete a specific task

2. **Data Model:** A task might has attributes like `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

3. **Database:** Choose a database to store tasks. Use a relational database like PostgreSQL database. Design the schema or document structure accordingly.

4. **API Server:** Create a Golang server using a framework like "gin" to handle the HTTP requests and interact with the database.

5. **API Logic:** Implement the logic for each endpoint. For example, when a POST request is made to `/tasks`, parse the incoming JSON data and insert a new task into the database.

6. **Validation:** Implement input validation and error handling. Ensure that the data sent by the client is properly validated before processing it.

7. **Authentication and Authorization:** There won't be any users for now, however for an update consider adding a user.

8. **Error Handling:** Define a consistent way to handle errors and provide meaningful error responses to clients.

9. **Testing:** Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the API behaves as expected.

10. **Documentation:** Create clear and concise documentation for the API endpoints, including how to use them, what data to send, and what to expect in responses.

11. **Deployment:** Use "render" and make use of the auto deploy and free PostgreSQL database, to deploy the API.

12. **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement logging to track errors and events within the application to keep an eye on the API's performance.

## Summary

- Gin for https server and routing
- PostgreSQL for database
- Render as hosting server
- Github to deploy code to Render
